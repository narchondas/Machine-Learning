⚡ Fun fact: I love swimming in the sea for more than an hour so, a couple of times, my friends were so worried that they wanted to call the coast guards as they assumed something bad had happened to me

## In the module Machine Learning I shall:

	Learn about the key paradigms and algorithms in machine learning.

	Get an understanding of data analytics based on machine learning and using modern programming tools, such as Python or R.

	Experience how machine learning and data analytics can be used in real-world applications.

	Acquire the ability to gather and synthesise information from multiple sources to aid in the systematic analysis of complex problems using machine learning tools and algorithms.

## On completion of the module Machine Learning, I will be able to:

	Articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.

	Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.

	Apply and critically appraise machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved.

	Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.
